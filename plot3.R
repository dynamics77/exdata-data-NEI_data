#Instead of plotting summaries I am using boxplots with the emissions data overlayed.
#I believe plotting more of the actual data allows identfication of outliers,
#relationships, correlations, etc.

#Note use of Y-log scale that allows to spread out data.
# However, 0 values of Emission on the logaritmic rescaling of y-axis provides "-Inf"
# To solve this problem replace all "0"-values to 
# "1" values. Note that this is reasonable because log(1)=0!
# In addition means are shown in the diamond shape on the box plot using stat_summary()
#Note: Outliers shown in "hotpink" color
#geom_jitter used to see overlapped data points
